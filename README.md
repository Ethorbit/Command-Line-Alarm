# Command-Line-Alarm

### Command-Line-Alarm is a Windows command line application developed in C++
You can either run these 2 parameters in a command line manually:
* Time (10:30 AM)
<!-- --> 
Enter a 12 hour format for the time you wish the alarm to go off at

* Sound file path (C:/Desktop/playthis.wav)
<!-- --> This is the sound file that you want the alarm to automatically play when the time has come. It will start quiet and slowly repeat the with louder audio each time until you exit the program.

OR you can run the program normally and enter the data within.
