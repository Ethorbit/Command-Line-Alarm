# Command-Line-Alarm

### Command-Line-Alarm is a Windows command line application developed in C++
You can either run these 2 parameters in a command line manually:
* Time (10:30 AM)
<!-- --> 
Enter a 12 hour format for the time you wish the alarm to go off at. Enter the word now in to debug the alarm without waiting.

* Sound file path (C:/Desktop/playthis.wav) - May not work if not .mp3 or .wav!
<!-- --> This is the sound file that you want the alarm to automatically play when the time has come. It will start quiet and slowly repeat louder each time it plays until you exit the program. The program may not be able to play anything that is not .wav or .mp3!
<br/><br/>
OR you can run the program normally and enter the data within.
